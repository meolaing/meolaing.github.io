                    <h3>Museums, Historic Sites, etc.</h4>
                        <h4>Harvard Museum of Natural History</h4>
                            <p>This is where we met! A lovely Natural History Museum on the Harvard campus, just north of Harvard Square. If you have the chance to go, definitely check out the Glass Flowers exhibit.</p>
                        <h4>New England Aquarium</h4>
                            <p>Multifloor cylindrical tank with helical ramp traveling around. Wide variety of penguins of different species on the ground level.</p>
                        <h4>Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</h4>
                            <p>Boston's enormous world-class fine art museum.</p>
                        <h4>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</h4>
                            <p>Museum that began as the private collection of philanthropist and art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner.</p>
                        <h4>Longfellow House / Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site</h4>                        
                            <p>George Washington trained troops here, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow lived in this Colonial-era house just west of Harvard Square. Free historic tours by Park Service rangers during the spring, summer and fall. 
                        <h4>Freedom Trail</h4>
                            <p>The Freedom Trail is a 2.5-mile brick line that passes through Boston and Charlestown connecting many of the city's most famous historic sites. There are a lot of great things to see along the path, but there isn't enough time to look at them in one day. We suggest picking a few that are near each other to visit. Website <a href="http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/">here</a>.</p>



                        <h3>Active Diversions</h3>
                        <h4>Charles River Canoe and Kayak</h4> 
                            <p>Paddle a canoe, kayak, or stand-up paddleboard on the river that divides Cambridge and Boston. One location in Allston, the other near Kendall Square.</p>
                        <h4>Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University</h4> 
                            <p>A large, sprawling park with green hills and pretty trees. This is the second place where we met! Orange Line accessible.</p>
                        <h4>Blue Hills Reservation</h4>
                            <p>Hiking with rough terrain just outside of Boston. One side is Red Line accessible (near Shea Memorial Rink). The other side has a small museum with trail maps (Mass. Audubon Trailside Museum. Trail maps available <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/parks/trails/blue-hills-map-2014.pdf">here</a> (pdf).</p>

               

                        <h3>Places to Eat</h3>
<h4>Harvard Square</h4>
                        <h4>Cafe Sushi</h4>
<p>This is the best sushi restaurant in Cambridge (and probably the best value to money ratio for any sushi place in the Boston area). Innovative flavors for signature sushi and daily specials fresh from Japan.</p>

<h4>Cilantro</h4> 
<p>There isn't much Cilantro in the food here at all: "Cilantro" is a pun in Mandarin Chinese that sounds like the title of a Chinese opera, and the walls have Chinese opera prints. This is where we go when craving Chinese food.</p>

<h4>Parsnip Restaurant and Lounge</h4>
<p>We consider Parsnip the best fine-dining restaurant and cocktail lounge in Harvard Square, with consistently great food and drinks.</p>

<h4>BonChon / Kaju Tofu House / Shake Shack / Maharajah Indian</h4>
<p>Right across from Parsnip is a building that hosts four of our favorites: two Korean restaurants, an Indian restaurant, and a burger joint. Just don't eat at Wagamama. Or Staples.</p>

<h4>Mike's Pastry</h4>
<p>Cannoli and cream puffs in two locations: North End and Harvard Square.</p>

<h4>Downtown Boston</h4>
<h4>Saus</h4>
<p>Delicious Belgian waffles, fries and a wide selection of Belgian ales and local beers downtown.</p> 

<h4>Taranta</h4>
<p>Peruvian-Italian fusion at the entrance to the North End (a traditionally Italian neighborhood). Their <i>paiche</i> and <i>patatas</i> are excellent.</p>
